# current project status

i have created a 3d connect 4 game as a prototype which can be found at https://3d-connect-4.antha.earth and which currently supports exactly two players and one online game at a time. that said anyone can remix the project by going to https://glitch.com/edit/#!/3d-connect-4 and selecting remix project from the dropdown in the upper left corner at which point they will have their own copy of the game they can play. You can also play with in-person if the other player is using the same web browsing device as you.

i have also started a 3d chess game
